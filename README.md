## Introduction
Manifest is a grid-based pinboard for note taking. Simply click anywhere to create as many notes as you want and snap them to the grid set by your current window size. All notes can be be moved, resized and deleted. Your browser's local storage is also utilized to save notes between sessions.

## Report Bugs
Please create a Github [issue](https://github.com/jonathontoon/manifest/issues), following the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and provide as much information as possible regarding the bug, including screenshots or error codes.

## Donate
Manifest is free and will always be free. However if you'd like to contribute a small donation via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/jonathontoon/) to help pay for domain and server costs it would be greatly appreciated.

## Acknowledgements
